In addition, the heart of this book is filled with technical specificity on Web page creation (for example, a section under "Graphics" is titled "GIF87a versus GIF89a). Readers looking for more conceptual explanations of Web design and layout would be better served with other titles. But for day-to-day development and maintenance, Web Design in a Nutshell is a truly well-constructed toolkit.', 1, 0, 0);

HTML 4 for the World Wide Web: Visual QuickStart Guide will teach you what you need to know quickly. 
The book covers the latest specifications of HTML 4 set by the World Wide Web Consortium, from the most basic tags that place text, images, and links on the page to more complex ones that set up tables, frames, or forms. New to this fourth edition, the book provides a chapter on debugging, including browser compatibility issues, expanded sections on cascading style sheets, JavaScript, and CGI scripts for use with forms.
As with all Visual QuickStart Guides, HTML 4 features clear and concise instructions side by side with well-captioned illustrations and screen shots that show both the source code and the resulting effect on the Web page. The index is extremely detailed, making this a   od reference book for intermediate users who are already familiar with basic HTML but need help with specific topics.
The book also includes extensive and useful appendices. One offers a chart that describes each tag (along with its compatibility with Netscape Navigator and/or Microsoft Internet Explorer.) Other appendices show the code for special symbols, hexadecimal equivalents for RGB colors, and a comparison chart for some of the HTML editors on the market. All in all, this is the perfect desktop reference for Web designers.', 0, 0, 0);

Based on C++ it contains features similar to those of Java. The intention is to combine the computing power of C++ with the programming ease of Visual Basic. 
C# has been created with the Internet in mind and an aim to balance power with productivity. It provides rapid web development for the C++ and C programmer. 
Forming part of the new .NET initiative, C# is designed to be used in conjunction with Microsoft''s .NET platform of products. C# makes use of XML data and SOAP in order to simplify programming, these facilities allow the user to build on existing code rather than making repeated duplications. C# is expected to make it faster and less expensive to market new products and services.
